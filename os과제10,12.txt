size of virtual/physical address space = 2^12 = 4096bytes. Page size = 256bytes = 2^8
therefore 12-8 = 4high-order bits of logical address represent page number and 
8 low order bits represent page offset

where 9 represents virtual page number(vpn) and EF represents offset,
From the given table the page number for the vpn 9 is, 
The physical address is  0EF

where 1 represents virtual page number(vpn) and 11 represents offset,
From the given table the page number for the vpn 1 is, 2
The physical address is 211

where 7 represents virtual page number(vpn) and 00 represents offset,
Read page 7 to free page frame D
답) D00?

corresponds to page 0-> read page 0 to free page frame E
-> physical address = EFF
답) EFF?
